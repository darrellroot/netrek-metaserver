# List of sites on our "bad" list.  They get a standard "go away" message
# if they try to connect.  [actually, they just get dropped]
#
# Future enhancement, for entire subdomains, allowing tailored messages:
# exclude: ip-addr ip-mask message-file
#

#
# List of servers; runs until end of file.  MetaServerII will use the IP
# address if one is given; if you use 0.0.0.0 it will resolve the domain
# name at startup time.
#
# Note that this format is identical to the FAQ server list; just cut & paste.
# If you plan to take MetaServerII up and down frequently, put the most
# popular servers near the top, so that they can be scanned right away when
# the program comes up.
