Welcome to MetaServerII's News & Information port!


METASERVER-II SERVICES:

Port 3520 has the "look & feel" of the original METASERVER.  It's fully
    compatible with programs like XNetrekM.
Port 3521 is a new and improved format.  It incorporates some of the
    suggestions seen on rec.games.netrek.
Port 3522 provides verbose output, giving player lists (when available) as
    well as all of the information available from the above two ports.
Port 3523 is what you are reading now.
Port 3524 is the server list posted to rec.games.netrek once per month.  It
    has a complete list of known public servers, with some detailed info
    about each.
Port 3525 is the MetaServerII config file.  Server admins may want to look
    at this to see if/how their server is listed.
Port 3530 is the list of RSA public keys.  This is only useful for server
    administrators; you don't need this just to play.

You can save a copy of the info with:

	telnet metaserver.netrek.org <port> > file

(replace <port> with one of the numbers above.)


EXPLANATION OF "FLAGS":

 T  Means that at some point in the lifetime of the MetaServerII process there
    were >= 8 players on this server ("T-mode").
 D  Means that this server hasn't responded since MetaServerII started
    watching ("always Dead").
 R  Means that this server supports (and may REQUIRE) RSA validation.

The server types are as follows.  These are broad categories, indicating a
general "feel" of play.
 B  Bronco - standard scam/bronco sources.
 P  Paradise - paradise-style server.
 S  Sturgeon - upgrades and weird weapons, planets, etc.
 C  Chaos - lots of really whacked out mods.
 H  Hockey - works like hockey.
 F  Dogfighting - dogfighting server.


I CAN'T SEEM TO GET THE ENTIRE LISTING

Try sending it to a file:
("telnet metaserver.netrek.org 3521 > /tmp/mlist; cat /tmp/mlist").
If that doesn't work, I have a short (70 line) program which WILL work.
Send mail and I'll forward it.


MASS RETRIEVALS:

DO NOT run scripts or MS-II clients that automatically read in every port
every time.  If everybody ran one of these the extra load would be difficult
to bear.  Ask for all the information you want, but don't load up the network
with requests for information you're not interested in (the clients usually
get both ports 3520 and 3521, which contains essentially identical
information, and the faq from port 3524, which most people don't need to read
more than once or twice).

Repeat offenders will be added to the "exclude" list, which blocks a host
from all access.  Currently ALL of richsunN.gatech.edu is blocked for
exactly this reason.


WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION?

Try rec.games.netrek.  Use "rn", "readnews", "vnews", "nn", "notes", or
whatever else you have to read Usenet news.  If you can't quite figure it
out, ask someone on your system.

There's a Frequently Asked Questions list for rec.games.netrek.  I would
include it here except that you really ought to be reading the newsgroup
anyway.

 Access for the masses : anonymous FTP to gs69.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.206.167).
 If you have AFS, look in /afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/jch/netrek.  If you have WAIS,
 use the netrek-ftp database, available on port 6000 of gourd.srv.cs.cmu.edu.

Grab all the files you can from this site, and READ THEM.

USEFUL STUFF

-----
Article 7402 (57 more) in rec.games.netrek:
From: jjudy@argon.berkeley.edu (Jack W. Judy)

I find the following simple command line filters useful to remove
the less usefull info of the outstanding MS II.

Add them to your .aliases or .login files if you think they're useful.

telnet metaserver.ecst.csuchico.edu 3521 | grep "h " | grep -v "Nobody playing"
| grep -v "Not responding"

telnet metaserver.ecst.csuchico.edu 3522 | egrep '^Server:|^.. ..  ...'
